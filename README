Notes:

- Enhanced AQWA with command line invocation.
- Generate an executable JAR file called runaqwa.jar from source code
- hadoop jar runaqwa.jar 
    Displays all the commands available.
- hadoop jar runaqwa.jar command=counts input=inputfile output=counts
    Generates count file required for partitioning
- hadoop jar runaqwa.jar partition input=inputfile output=indexfolder k=number_partitions counts=countfile
    This generates the partitions using the count file generated before.
    It creates "k" partitions.
- hadoop command=msample input=inputfile count=countsfile numfile=partitions sample=[FIRST|RANDOM|ACE] partiton=[True/False]
    This runs the AQWA experiments with ACE Tree or RANDOM.
    It can re-use partitions that have been generated before
    The query results are stored in a Hadoop folder called temp_query_results.
